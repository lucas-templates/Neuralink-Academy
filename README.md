## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- No server or build tools required - this is a static website

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone or Download** the project files to your local machine

2. **Open the Website**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local development server:
     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js (http-server)
     npx http-server
     ```

3. **View in Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (if using a server)
   - Or directly open the `index.html` file

### No Build Process Required

This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with CDN-hosted libraries (Bootstrap), so no compilation or build step is necessary.

## 💡 Intended Use

### Educational & Demonstration Purposes

This landing page is designed for:

- **Portfolio Showcase** - Demonstrating advanced front-end development skills
- **Design Inspiration** - Showcasing modern UI/UX trends including glassmorphism, gradient animations, and interactive visualizations
- **Learning Resource** - Educational example of:
  - Canvas API implementation
  - CSS animation techniques
  - Responsive design patterns
  - Interactive form handling
- **Concept Presentation** - Visualizing futuristic educational technology concepts
- **Template Foundation** - Starting point for similar landing pages or educational platforms

### Customization Ideas

- Modify color schemes in CSS variables (`:root` section in `styles.css`)
- Add real backend integration for the learning path generator
- Implement actual neurofeedback data visualization
- Extend with additional sections (testimonials, pricing, blog)
- Integrate with a CMS or learning management system
